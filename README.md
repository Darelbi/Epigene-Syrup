# Epigene-Syrup
c# Genetic algorithm library



The idea is to implemente epigenetics.


These are my main points after brainstorming.

At this point the algorithm is already designed (only a point to explore, the growable neural network)

I just need to implement it.

If you are in hurry and need that I can give details on the algorithm
provided you credit me.

- Genetic Algorithm with Epigenetic Factors:
  - Incorporate epigenetic factors into genetic algorithms.
  - Use epigenetic factors to influence execution paths in syntax trees.
- Smooth Transition Between Syntax Branches:
  - Implement continuous transitions between branches based on epigenetic factors.
  - Use weighted combinations instead of hard conditional branches.
- Fixed Number of Epigenetic Factors:
  - Decide on a fixed number of epigenetic factors in advance.
  - Ensure the neural network can handle this fixed input size.
- Neural Network Integration:
  - Use a neural network to manage and adjust epigenetic factors.
  - Implement forward and backward propagation to optimize fitness.
- Dynamic Input Handling:
  - Explore methods to progressively increase the number of inputs for the neural network.
  - Consider approaches like Progressive Neural Networks, dynamic input layers, and incremental learning.
- Fitness Evaluation and Adaptation:
  - Evaluate fitness considering both execution paths influenced by epigenetic factors.
  - Implement a feedback loop to adjust epigenetic factors based on their impact on fitness
